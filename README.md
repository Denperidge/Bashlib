# CSS-Suite
This repository contains a suite of functionality created for the Community Solid Server.
These tools are developed for the Mellon project on Decentralized Scholarly Communication.

## [CSS](https://github.com/MellonScholarlyCommunication/css-suite/tree/master/tools/css)
This tooling provides a set of basic commands for the Community Solid Server (v2.x.x).
They are provided using a CLI tool `bin/css.js` that enables you to run the commands from the cli, or they can be imported in your own Node.js projects.

## [Solid](https://github.com/MellonScholarlyCommunication/css-suite/tree/master/tools/solid)
This tooling provides a set of basic commands that are reworked to work with the Solid ecosystem.
They are provided using a CLI tool `bin/solid.js` that enables you to run the commands from the cli, or they can be imported in your own Node.js projects.



## [Solid-Shell](https://github.com/MellonScholarlyCommunication/css-suite/tree/master/tools/solid-shell)
This is an in-development interactive shell environment for Solid where all created tools can be used in the interactive shell.
Additional functionality such as `cd` for moving through the solid filesystem is also in early development.
